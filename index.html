        <b>Focus Question:</b> <br>
        How do computer simulations simulate the motion and interaction of rigid bodies in two dimensions?
        How do forces, kinematics, energy, and momentum influence the behavior of these bodies?
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Physics Simulations</b> <br>
        In todayâ€™s world, we are surrounded by computers and technology. These computers can perform a multitude 
        of different tasks, some of which include connecting people across the world, displaying movies, managing 
        financial transactions, and even controlling complex machinery. One of the common applications of the 
        modern computer is its ability to simulate the real world; whether it's sending a rocket to the moon or 
        playing a first-person shooter video game, physics simulations play a crucial role. Physics simulations 
        allow us to predict real-world events, saving money and resources that would otherwise be necessary. In 
        my self-directed study, I plan to explore a specific area of computer-simulated physics: rigid body dynamics. 
        Rigid body dynamics is, by definition, the behavior of bodies as they move and interact with each other 
        and their environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>What is a rigid body?</b> <br>
        A rigid body is an idealized physical object that does not deform under external forces, maintaining its 
        shape, size, and internal structure. While no real-world object is perfectly rigid, simulating a rigid body 
        requires much less computation power and simplifies the complexity of a true-to-world simulation. In the 
        simulations I will be observing and creating, I will assume that every physical object is a rigid body.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>How might you create a simulation using a computer?</b> <br>
        A computer takes an input, and using the given instructions, it returns an output. Unfortunately, computers 
        cannot understand human languages such as English or French. Instructions given to computers must be in binary. 
        Binary is a system of information encoding using bits; each bit represents a state, either 1 (on) or 0 (off). 
        Over the years, engineers have been able to improve the process of writing computer code. Instead of having to 
        manually write 0s and 1s, we can now write code in more human-like languages. The code is then translated or 
        compiled into machine code (binary). There are hundreds of coding languages one can choose from, I will be 
        using a mix of javascript and sudo-code (a mix of English and code).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Euler Integration</b> <br>
        The most popular method for integrating force into the other equations for motion is the Implicit Euler Method. 
        This method uses numerical integration to find the solution for the next step in time. As opposed to using an 
        analytical approach, a numerical approach saves computation time but comes with inherent error. The Implicit 
        Euler Method is more accurate than the Explicit Euler Method, which is why most commercial applications of 
        physics simulations use the Implicit Method, such as Unity (a popular game development engine). The first step 
        in the Implicit Euler method is to take the current velocity and add to it the acceleration multiplied by the 
        delta time. \( \vec{v}_{n+1} = \vec{v}_n + \vec{a} \cdot \Delta t \) To find the new position we take the new 
        velocity, multiply by the delta time, and add it to the current position. \( \vec{d}_{n+1} = \vec{d}_n + \vec{v}_{n+1} \cdot \Delta t \) The method becomes more accurate as t approaches 0. In an ideal world, we could 
        simulate thousands of times every second to receive the most accurate results possible, unfortunately, this is 
        not possible in real life and we will have to settle with 60 simulation steps per second.
      </p>

        <b>Comparing the kinematic equations to the Semi-Implicit Euler Method</b> <br>
        As I mentioned before in the section on Euler Integration there will be errors when using any of the various numerical integration techniques (some more than others). 
        Using the kinematic equations and comparing the results to the Semi-Implicit Euler method, we find that when simulating at low delta times we end up with very impressive results.

        <b>Adding in forces <br></b>
        When using numerical integration to solve for the motion of a rigid body the only parameters that we care about are the forces acting on our object and the mass of the object. 
        Using both the mass and the force we can solve for the acceleration and then use the aforementioned methods to solve for the other properties of motion. 
        $$\vec{F} = m \vec{a} \quad \quad \vec{a} = \frac{\vec{F}}{m}$$ Knowing this, we now have everything needed to work out what will happen every at every step of our simulation.

        $$\vec{F} = \vec{F_g} + \vec{F_a} + \vec{F_N} + \vec{F_f}$$
        $$\vec{a} = \frac{\vec{F}}{m}$$

        $$\vec{v}_{n+1} = \vec{v}_n + \vec{a} \cdot \Delta t$$
        $$\vec{d}_{n+1} = \vec{d}_n + \vec{v}_{n+1} \cdot \Delta t$$
